ESP8266 07/12 breakout with two Integrated Voltage Regulators (SPX3819M5-L-3-3) for 3v3 (500mA or 1A) and LEDs for Power, RX, TX and Charging. It has a solder jump to connect GPIO16 with RST in order to enable deep sleep. It also has an integrated LiPol charger (MCP73831), and a Mini-USB port for charging and direct programming through an integrated FTL232RL.

This is a **work in progress** so use at your own risk.
